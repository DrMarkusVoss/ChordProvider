# ChordProvider
Extend single base notes played on a Keyboard or Synthesizer attached via USB MIDI by further notes to form chords according to selected key.
These further notes are transmitted back to to the sender of the original base note, so that by playing one note on the keyboard or synth you get
a full chord with just one finger used.
